🕹️ Battleship Game

A classic Battleship game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript — featuring a smart AI opponent that learns and adapts to your moves. Inspired by retro aesthetics and focused on keyboard-driven gameplay.

    🎓 This project is part of The Odin Project JavaScript curriculum.

🎮 Features

    Retro UI: Black background, neon green grid lines — inspired by old-school Atari vibes.

    Keyboard-Based Controls: Enter coordinates manually for attacks.

    AI Opponent: The CPU tracks hits, deduces ship orientation, and prioritizes efficient targeting.

    Grid-Based Gameplay: Classic 10x10 grid system with vertical and horizontal ship placement.

    Game State Logging: Console logs for debugging and insight into CPU strategy.

🧠 How the CPU Works

The CPU:

    Tracks successful hits and infers ship orientation (vertical or horizontal).

    Prioritizes adjacent cells and extends attack lines intelligently.

    Clears its attack strategy once a ship is sunk.

    Never attacks the same cell twice.
